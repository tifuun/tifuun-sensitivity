    "- Defining input structures and parameters.\n",
    "- Running a calculation.\n",
    "- Understanding the output format.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we discuss the input structures. We will define the telescope and instrument. Then, we will discuss an important input: the radiative transfer cascade. Lastly, we discuss some other input parameters that pertain to details unrelated to the telescope, instrument, or cascade, which are important for calculating some output quantities. \n",
